# Suffragist

A one-file Sinatra voting app that would fit in
a gist, suitable for teaching Ruby web-development basics.

# Setup

Clone this repository and run `bundle` or just
`gem install sinatra`, the sole dependency.

Start the application with `ruby suffragist.rb`.

Visit [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) to cast your first vote.

If you want to have automatic app reloading when you
edit the file you can `gem install rerun` and start
the application with `rerun suffragist.rb` instead.

# Tutorial

Please see [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md) for
the tutorial that can be used with this app.
